                        Okay soo this is my "over it" playlist. I wrote it when I first realised I had a problem with

                        Jade was inspired by the bratz character, jade. Pretty much because Jade was mean to be the
                        smart one in the live
                        action so this is basically my academia x glow up x baddie with a degree playlist. Like a
                        playlist to inspire the best version of me. I could easily have named it techna but we move

                        Fun fact! I listen to "rawr xD people" music. I have <i>no idea</i> how it happened but I think
                        it's the guitars and the whole caucasian crush thing. Then again I've been about Marianas
                        trench since year 8 (I need to rewatch The Next Step broo). My favourite song atm from here is
                        probably "Missing" by Flyleaf - I'm listening to it rn hehehe.<br><br>

                        LOOOOOL GUYS this playlist was basically made as a vibe. I was just so tired of writing about
                        him and being bugged and screaming "I'm a bad b I don't need him." like???? Sometimes shut up
                        bro.
                        <br> But yeah it's just my confidence and baddie phase mixed with taylor swift and more pop

                    Other than that, I don't have much else to add ngl. I recently listened to jhene's album and
                    honestly it
                    feels so soft but I'm not in the mood for breakup playlists, like??? I've been trying to
                    centre this
                    for
                    a while now, I'm bugging the fRICk out ibr but it doesn't have to be perfect. it's okay mi
                    amor.
